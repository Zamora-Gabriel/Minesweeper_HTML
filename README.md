####**Download/Install**
---------
 - Browse to demo link
 - [Download Zip](https://github.com/Zamora-Gabriel/Minesweeper_Introhtml5_A2.git)
 - Clone or Download the zip and uncompress it on your desired directory


####**How to use**
--------
 - Using VsCode create a live server (npx live-server on the directory where the uncompressed zip is)
 - Once the browser pops up, the splash page will show up first
 - Click on any of the radio box options that indicate the dimensions of the grid to play
 - Once checked a radio box, press the "start game" button
 - The game page will be loaded and you can hover over the red buttons that will be the mine cells
 - if you click one of those cells, the cell changes its color to blue; however, it will revert to its original color once clicked on any other thing
 - For now, the timer box shows "Game Over" button which will send to the score/game over page when clicked. (Button will be changed for a timer)
 - On the Score/Game Over Page, you can click on any of the two buttons but each one will redirect to different pages.
 - The return to splash button will return to the first page shown while the restart game will restart the grid and redirect you to the game page.
